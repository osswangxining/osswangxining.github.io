## LPWAN is for IoT

One technology cannot serve all of the projected applications and volumes for IoT.
- WiFi and BTLE are widely adopted standards and serve the applications related to communicating personal devices quite well.
- Cellular technology is a great fit for applications that need high data throughput and have a power source.
- LPWAN offers multi-year battery lifetime and is designed for sensors and applications that need to send small amounts of data over long distances a few times per hour from varying environments.
